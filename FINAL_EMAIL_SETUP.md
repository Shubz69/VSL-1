# ✅ FINAL EMAIL SETUP - ALL EMAILS TO Shabzfazl@gmail.com

## Code is Already Updated ✅

The code has been updated to send ALL emails to: **Shabzfazl@gmail.com**

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT: You Must Update Vercel

The email you received was from an OLD deployment. You need to:

### Step 1: Update Vercel Environment Variables

Go to: **Vercel → Your Project → Settings → Environment Variables**

#### Update/Add Variable 1: EMAIL_USER
```
Shabzfazl@gmail.com
```
This is the Gmail account that will SEND the emails (must match the app password account)

#### Update/Add Variable 2: EMAIL_PASSWORD  
```
ahqeoi poi qgzvbjg
```
This is the app password (spaces will be removed automatically)

#### Keep Variable 3: DATABASE_URL
```
mysql://root:PqrldZpsOMQoWLFErteQBxdtQpMNTiDg@yamanote.proxy.rlwy.net:18593/railway
```

### Step 2: Redeploy Vercel

1. Go to **Deployments** tab
2. Click **"..."** on latest deployment  
3. Click **"Redeploy"**
4. Wait for deployment to finish

### Step 3: Test

After redeploy, submit the form again. The email should now go to:
- ✅ **Shabzfazl@gmail.com** (correct)

NOT to:
- ❌ Shubzfx@gmail.com (old)

## Summary

- **Code updated:** ✅ Emails go to Shabzfazl@gmail.com
- **Vercel needs:** Environment variables updated + redeploy
- **After redeploy:** All new form submissions will email Shabzfazl@gmail.com
